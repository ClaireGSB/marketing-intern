export const blogStrategy = `
  We use our blog for SEO purposes and to attract new language learners to our platform.
  We generally target common keywords people are likely to search for when leaning another language, like "Write a resume in English" or "May I vs Can I".
  We cover most languages, but the blog posts for now are in English, even if they are about another language.
  Blog posts should be educative and provide value to the reader. Most of them should not be about our product, but we do include some examples of how Nativish could help.
